## Milestone 1

Milestone 1 aims to deliver the most basic Machine Learning APIs to solve basic ML problems.

##### APIs

APIs that will be usable with the milestone 1 release include:

1. Cluster methods/classes..
- KMeans

2. Ensemble classes...
-  Random Forest

3. Feature extractions..
- CounterVectorizer

4. Linear models..
- Linear Regression

5. Metrics
- zeroOneLoss
- confusion_matrix
- accuracyScore

6. Model Selections..

- train_test_split
- KFold

7. neighbors

- KNeighborsClassifier
- KDTree

8. preprocessing

- Imputer
- LabelEncoder
- OneHotEncoder
- MinMaxScaler
- Binarizer

9. SVM

- BaseSVM
- SVR
- SVC
- OneClassSVM
- NuSVR
- NuSVC

10. tree

- DecisionTreeClassifier


In the series of milestone deliveries, I would like to cover all the APIs listed
in the below mindmap.

#### Development

1. Enjoy and learn while implementing the various ML algorithms/models
2. Almost 100% test coverage
3. Automated documentation process by using Typedoc and the custom doc processors [source](https://github.com/JasonShin/kalimdorjs/tree/master/docs/processor)
4. Site layout generation using Vuepress
5. Documentation website uploaded to either Netlify or Github page
6. Simple development process for now (feature branching)
